<a name="otherassets"><h3><u>Integrating with Other Asset Packages</u></h3></a>

<p>There are a number of Unity Assets available that will help make your game great. Some of those have complimentary overlaps with First Person Exploration Kit. As a result, you may want to integrate part of another Asset Package with First Person Exploration Kit.</p>

<br/>
<a name="ufps"><h3>UFPS</h3>

<p>An integration guide has been created for using UFPS v1.7.3 as the base player controller with First Person Exploration Kit.</p>

<span class="note"><u>Note</u>: The fall 2018 "version 2" UFPS asset has not yet been tested with this integration package.</span>

<p><a href="http://whilefun.com/gamefiles/downloads/ufpsbridge/UFPS_FPEKit_Bridge.zip">Download the UFPS v1.7.3 integration script and full integration instructions</a>.</p>

<br/>
<h3>Other Assets</h3>

<span class="note"><u>Note</u>: Some other asset packages may not work "out of the box" with First Person Exploration Kit. But, if you have a specific integration in mind for your game, please <a href="mailto:support@whilefun.com">send an email</a> with details and we can see how the two packages may work together. Usually small modifications to either or both packages will yield a good result.</span>
