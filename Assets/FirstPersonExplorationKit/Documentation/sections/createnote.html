<h2>First Person Exploration Kit: Creating an Attached Note</h2>

<br/>

<p>Attached Notes are a special type of Interactable because they are used to compliment other types through a passive interaction. For example, you might attach a note to a journal or a statue or other object that provides context and background about the object, or serves as a reminder of the object the player saw.</p>

<h3><u>Attached Note</u></h3>

<ol>
<li>Create any other Interactable type (e.g. Journal, Static, Pickup, etc.)</li>
<li>Add FPEAttachedNote to your object, and set the following variables to suit your object:</li>
<ul>
<li>Note Title: For example "The old book"</li>
<li>Note Body: For example, the text found in a relevant book page containing a spell or puzzle clue.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is an image showing the inspector of the example Journal object with a Note Attached.</p>

<br/>

<li>Run the scene, and interact with the Interactable with the attached note to collect the note.</li>
</ol>

<p>When the note is retrieved, a text and sound notification will be presented at the bottom of the screen:</p>

<p>Notes are automatically included in saved game data. To read the note contents, open the Notes tab in the inventory screen and click on the title of interest:</p>

<p>You can attach a note to any type of Interactable object. But if you want a literal note in your game (e.g. a yellow sticky note) with a note as its only result, just make a <a href="createstatic.html">Static type interactable</a> and attach the FPEAttachedNote script to it.</p>
