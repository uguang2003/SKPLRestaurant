<h2>First Person Exploration Kit: Getting Started</h2>


<br/>
<h3><u>Demo Scenes</u></h3>

<p>There are 3 demo scenes provided with the asset that show how you can create objects of every type in the asset. These demo scenes also provide a core game loop from Main Menu through the 
2 demo levels and back. Please refer to these levels for ideas and details on how your prefabs and other functionality can best take advantage of the provided functionality.</p>


<h3><u>Creating a Brand New Scene</u></h3>

<p>Below are the simple steps required to go from a new Unity Scene to a playable interactable scene using First Person Exploration Kit:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new Unity Scene</li>
<li>Delete the Main Camera</li>
<li>Add some geometry such as a plane or cube for the player to walk on</li>
<li>Add an instance of the FPECore prefab</li>
<li>Run your scene</li>
<li>To add interactions, place some of the provided demo prefabs such as the demoSoup or demoApple into your scene.</li>
<li>Run your scene again, and walk over to the objects and interact with them.</li>
</ol>

<p>You're ready to start creating your own interactions!</p>
