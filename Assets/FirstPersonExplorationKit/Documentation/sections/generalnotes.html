<h2>First Person Exploration Kit: General Notes</h2>

<h3><u>Other Package Notes</u></h3>

<h3>Demo Assets</h3>

<p>The following files are provided to demonstrate examples and as a base to create your own game. However, you can discard them if you don't need them.</p>

<ul>
<li>All prefabs in the Prefabs > DemoPrefabs folder (e.g. "demoCabinet")</li>
<li>All prefabs in the Resources > InventoryItems and Resources > Pickups folder (e.g. "demoSoup")</li>
<li>All sounds in the Resources > AudioDiaryAudioClips</li>
<li>All assets in the Materials > DemoMaterials folder (and if so, the Shaders folder as it is only referenced by demo materials)</li>
<li>All scripts in the Scripts > DemoScripts folder</li>
<li>All textures in the Textures > DemoTextures folder</li>
<li>All models and materials in the Models folder and sub folders</li>
<li>All Sounds in the Sounds folder</li>
<li>All files in the Testing folder</li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to delete the above items as you see fit.</p>

<span class="note"><u>Note</u>: The Resources folder contains 6 sounds. These are critical for the package to function correctly. However, you may 
modify or replace them so long as the filename is not changed.</span>

<h3> Secondary Audio on Interact</h3>

<span class="warning">
<img src="img/warningLightSmall.jpg">&nbsp;This feature will be deprecated in the future. Please use the new Interactable Events to play additional audio content&nbsp;<img src="img/warningLightSmall.jpg">
</span>
<br/>

<p>All Interactable objects have a section in the Inspector with header "Optionally play a Secondary Sound on Interact". Under this heading, 
you can specify that the object's interaction trigger a secondary sound effect such as a narration or Audio Log like voice over. For most types, 
this occurs the first time you interact with the object. For example, when you pick up a "Pickup" type object.</p>

<p>When making your own custom complex Interactable objects (see demoToilet, and demoComplexRadio), you can opt-out of this behaviour 
altogether. However, the Inspector values will still appear as they are attached to the Interactable base class. To use this feature in your own 
custom scripts, just ensure that you make a call to base.interact() with the appropriate action (turning a knob, pressing a switch, breaking a 
window, etc.). If you don't know what any of this means, don't worry. It will "just work" if you ignore this feature entirely.</p>

<p>To add secondary audio to an object (for example, to narrate a Journal entry), set the following values in the inspector:</p>

<ul>
<li>Play Secondary Sound On Interact: Set to true to play a secondary sound.</li>
<li>Show With Text: Set to true of you want "Audio Log Style" text to appear.</li>
<li>Audio Log Text: This text will appear on the Audio Log UI when the sound is played, assuming you checked the "Show With Text" box.</li>
<li>Sound Playback Behaviour: Set to PLAY_ONCE to only play the first time (good for journal narration or spooky discoveries, for example). Set to PLAY_EVERY_TIME to play every time the interaction occurs.</li>
<li>Sound To Play On Interact: Select the audio file you want played. </li>
</ul>

<span class="note"><u>Note</u>: If you do not set a "Sound To Play On Interact", all other values for Secondary Sounds are ignored and no sound is played.</span>
